      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <img src="images/owners.jpg" alt="Owners of Olive St Coffee Co.">
      <p>It all began on the California Central Coast and we've been happily making coffee ever since.</p>
      <p>In October of 2017, after graduating from Cal Poly, we couldn't imagine leaving the comfort of the home we found within the San Luis Obispo community -- so we began our coffee journey.</p>
      <p>After experimenting with our family's favorite pastry recipes and drinking more cups of coffee than we could possibly count, we are proud to serve our combination daily homemade pastries, craft roasted coffee, and house-made syrups. We hope that you find our space as beautiful and relaxing as we do, but most importantly find a strong coffee you love and that keeps you going for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>In the time since opening, we've won "Best Coffee Shop" in both local polls every year, and have been written about by The New York Times, Sunset Magazine, The Guardian, Alton Brown, The Venue Report, AAA Westways Magazine, Sweet Paul, and many more.  In 2017, we were awarded "Business of the Year" at the Capital for California's 35th Assembly District.</p>
      <p>We are so honored that you have made Olive Street Coffee Co. the most sought after coffee destination on the Central Coast.</p>
      <p>Thank you for coming in and supporting our business.</p>
